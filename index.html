    <h2>Ideological Roots and Anger</h1>
    <p>Lough explores the factors that fueled the alt-right movement:</p>
    <li class="List1">White Identity: The ideology of the alt-right cannot be separated from
    discussions about white identity. Many followers believe that white people
    are being marginalized and pushed aside by people of color, immigrants,
    Muslims, and even women. They long for a return to a perceived golden era
    when traditional gender roles prevailed. 
   
    <li id="Listb" >Rejection of Mainstream
    Conservatism: The alt-right rejects mainstream Republicanism, considering it
    a betrayal of their cause. They view mainstream Republicans as having sold
    out their party.
    <h1>Social Media and Emboldenment</h1>
    <p>
      Lough also sheds light on how white nationalist social media platforms
      bolstered the alt-right movement. Additionally, President Trump’s
      controversial comments following the Charlottesville violence—where he
      placed blame “on many sides”—emboldened the movement further.

      “Alt-Right: Age of Rage” captures a pivotal moment in American history.
      The images from the rally, including Heather Heyer’s tragic death, serve
      as a stark reminder of the cyclical grip of violent racism.

      As we grapple with the legacy of this movement, understanding its roots
      and motivations becomes crucial. Lough’s documentary invites viewers to
      confront uncomfortable truths and engage in meaningful dialogue about the
      future of our nation.
